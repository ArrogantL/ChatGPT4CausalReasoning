e-CARE has two task:

1. Causal Discovery: e-CARE-main-code/dataset/Causal_Reasoning
2. Explainable Generation: e-CARE-main-code/dataset/Explanation_Generation

We provide train and valid sets to support local experiments.
Because that the dataset is randomly split, we expect the experimental results of ChatGPT on the training and development sets to be similar to those on the test set.

If you need to obtain results on the test set, 
please refer to the instructions provided here: https://github.com/Waste-Wood/e-CARE/blob/main/Submission%20Tutorial.md
