We conducted testing on the CEG task using the e-care test set.
Following the experimental setup outlined in the paper of e-CARE dataset,
the CEG predictions of ChatGPT on the complete e-care test set were used to calculate the automatic evaluation metrics AVG-BLEU and ROUGE-l.
Since the complete e-care test set is not publicly available, you can obtain the test results through the official e-care guidelines provided in github:

Therefore, we only provide the results of manual evaluation.
