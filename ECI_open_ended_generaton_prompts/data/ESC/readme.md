Please note that each line stored in the ChatGPT4CausalReasoning/data/ESC 
contains one sentence, with only two events and their causal relationship.

To facilitate the Open-ended generation experiment,
we have made modifications to the format.
Now, each line stores all the events in a sentence along with their causal relationships.
In other words, the multiple lines of data for the same sentence have been merged into a single line.
The stored content remains unchanged; only the formatting has been adjusted.
